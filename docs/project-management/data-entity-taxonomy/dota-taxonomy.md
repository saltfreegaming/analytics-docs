## Decision-Driven Analytics Considerations

These entities support multiple decision-making workflows:

1. **Matchmaking Balance:**
   - Use `dota_player_full_view` for effective rank/MMR distribution
   - Query `match_facts_v1` or `official_dota_matches_view` for team composition analysis
   - Identify calibration issues via `is_inaccurate_calibration` and `is_inaccurate_listing` flags
   - Detect smurfs using `sz_smurf_flag` and debug per-steam aggregates

2. **Captain Evaluation:**
   - Use `dota_league_stats_view` or `dota_overall_stats_view` for captain winrate delta
   - Filter for `games_played_as_captain >= threshold` to ensure sample size
   - Compare captain vs. player performance across tickets for promotion decisions

3. **League Health & Activity:**
   - Track active vs. inactive tickets via `dota_tickets.active`
   - Monitor match volume trends using `official_dota_matches_view` grouped by `ticket_id` and time
   - Identify abandoned tickets (low recent activity) for decommissioning

4. **Player Retention & Engagement:**
   - Join `club_members` with match participation to calculate activity recency
   - Segment by `join_date` cohorts for retention curve analysis
   - Use `left_date` for churn analysis and exit interviews

5. **Data Quality & Provider Reliability:**
   - Compare `rank_*` and `leaderboard_*` fields across providers (DotaBuff, Stratz, OpenDota)
   - Track `last_updated_*` timestamps to identify stale data
   - Monitor privacy flags (`is_private_*`) for coverage gaps
   - Audit override frequency via `dota_official_event_matches_overrides`

6. **Moderation & Governance:**
   - Use `command_audit` to track moderator actions and workload
   - Flag repeated calibration or listing issues for review
   - Analyze `role_note` for captain feedback patterns

7. **Smurf & Alt Detection:**
   - Cross-reference multiple `steam_users` per `member_id`
   - Use debug per-steam views to detect performance discrepancies across accounts
   - Correlate `sz_smurf_flag` with actual performance outliers
