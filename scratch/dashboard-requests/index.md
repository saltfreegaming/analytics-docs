# Dashboard Requests

Archive completed and approved dashboard feature requests (PRD-lite) for Salt Free Gaming analytics. Keep drafts in `scratch/` until reviewed; move finalized requests here so they stay discoverable alongside other project management artifacts.

---

## How to add a request

1. Copy `docs/templates-and-checklists/dashboard-request.md` into this folder and rename it to the dashboard name (e.g., `2024-08-discord-activity.md`).
2. Fill out requester/date, audience, phase, KPIs, data scope, UX expectations, and dependencies before marking the request complete.
3. Link any Superset drafts, mocks, or relevant threads; update the change log as scope evolves.
4. Add the new file to `mkdocs.yml` under **Project Management** if it should appear in the published navigation.
