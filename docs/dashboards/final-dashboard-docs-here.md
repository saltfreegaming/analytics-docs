# Finalized Dashboards

Add one Markdown page per released Superset dashboard. Use the [Dashboard Documentation Template](../templates-and-checklists/dashboard-template.md) and link each entry from the navigation once stable.

---

## How to add an entry

- Copy the template into this folder and rename the file to the dashboard name (e.g., `dota-players.md`).
- Populate overview, owner, audience, KPIs, data sources, validation steps, and change log.
- Include chart links and refresh cadence; note sensitivity and access roles.
- Keep the page updated after each release; summarize changes in the change log.
