# Operational Dashboard Spec: Execute Recruitment Operation

## 1) Deliverable (What This Slice Produces)

The dashboard shows an overall view of a player level performance, indicated by winrate.

---

## 2) Source of Truth (Do Not Re-define Here)
- Decision Brief: https://github.com/saltfreegaming/analytics-docs/blob/main/docs/project-management/decision-briefs/inaccurate-account-calibration.md
- Signal Design / Metric Definitions: https://github.com/saltfreegaming/analytics-docs/blob/main/docs/project-management/Decision/SIGNAL_DESIGNS.md
- Glossary (optional): -

**This document is the final build blueprint:** layout, default state, interaction model, caveats/guardrails, and acceptance criteria.

---

## 3) Scope
**In scope:** <what this dashboard slice covers operationally>  
This dashboard covers the initial signals of an inaccurate player rank calibration

**Out of scope (Non-goals):** <explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep>
The dashboard only covers winrate based signals, other indicators of player performance breakdown will be included in a future dashboard

---

## 4) Unit of Analysis (Grain)
**One row/item represents:**
Dot - Player
Filters/Segments : 
event(ticket)
role (account / player / match / case / event / member)  

**Primary time windows supported:**
Initial pass: lifetime, Past Year
 <e.g., 7d / 30d / 60d / season>  
 
**Eligibility rule (data sufficiency):** <minimum sample size or completeness required to interpret>
At least 30 games played in lifetime, further segments require 10 games played minimum

---

## 5) Acceptance Criteria (Dashboard-Level)
Define what “good” looks like for the dashboard artifact (not the business decision):
The dashboard should show a clear indicator of outlier players based on winrate.

- **Time-to-triage:** 
reviewer can identify potential entities in below 5mins
- **Self-sufficiency:** 
A reviewer can process entities through the dashboard and ascertain whether the entity should be flagged for further in-depth review
- **Clarity:** 
The full chart is available, with the filtered chart also available for a quicker pass. 
- **Correctness safeguards:** insufficient-data / not-eligible states are explicit and cannot be mistaken for “normal”
Time windows currently not enforced in all charts, can be introduced if needed  
Segmented winrates are still assessed with a 10 game minimum limit, and 30 overall game total minimum requirement. 
-Players not meeting requirements are not recorded on the dashboard. 
---

## 6) Dashboard Pattern (Choose One)
Default for operational workflows is **Queue → Details**.

- [ ] **Queue → Details** (ranked entities; click into evidence)
- [x] **Trend → Breakdown** (time trend then segmentation)
- [ ] **Funnel** (stage progression and drop-offs)
- [ ] **Cohort Comparison** (A vs B, before/after)


**Why this pattern fits the workflow:** <1–2 sentences, no metrics>
The usage of the dashboard is to spot outliers, then go into details to determine course of action

---

## 7) Information Architecture (Sections = Jobs-to-be-Done)
Define sections by what the user is trying to do, not by chart type.
Section 1 Overall winrate by ticket:
 The user checks the dashboard section to spot extreme winrates with reference to games played.
Section 2- Lobby rank division winrates:
 The user is able to check the dashboard for more info on the likely inaccurately calibrated players (60% winrate and higher), also with their corresponding rank brackets and winrates.
Section 3- Role winrate: 
The user is able to spot higher potential inaccurately calibrated players, with high overall winrates that accounts for roles played.



### Section A — Queue / Triage
**Job-to-be-done:** “Who should we look at first?”  
To identify inaccuracy in rank calibration, we can look at players with a higher than average winrate(assuming balanced shuffle) over a given period of time
(above 60%)
**Required outputs (must display):**
- <entity identifier(s)>
  Player names
- <priority score or ranking field>
  NA for initial pass, for detailed breakdown ranking score
- <recommended next step label (if applicable)>
  Identified players to be checked on the filtered chart/detailed breakdown
- <data sufficiency indicator (sample size / eligibility)>
  Ideally 30 games played total for accuracy, 10 games for minimum eligibility in segmented data
- <top 1–3 evidence highlights (short)>
  Cumulative winrate above 1.6 total, above 60% winrate by rank lobby exceeding their calibrated rank
**Primary interaction:**   
Step 1. Identifying potential inaccurate rank calibration candidates by hovering over the plots that are outliers on the charts
Step 2. Selecting player's name on the segmented charts to view their winrate breakdowns
Step 3. Confirming attributed winrate to known factors, make decision whether to flag the player for detailed review.
Additional steps: 
Review detailed breakdown for overperforming players(i.e:overperforming in 2 roles, underperforming in 1), and flag them for review  
**Optional:** export, copy link, quick filters (keep minimal).

---

### Section B — Evidence Panel (Entity Detail)
**Job-to-be-done:** “Why is this entity prioritized, and what’s the evidence?”  
60% winrate set as baseline winrate flag for further scrutiny, evidence for inaccurate rank calibration in winrate breakdowns
**Required outputs (must display):**
- Context fields needed to interpret metrics (always visible): <list>
  Winrates (0-1 scale), Rank Division, TicketID,
  50% winrate is expected, 5% deviation is normal due to small sample size, above 60% winrate is uncommon at larger sample sizes 
- **Diagnostic Cards** 
  Sample size(30) 
  time window (1 year)
  45-55% winrate expected, ~1.25-1.5 winrate cumulative expected


**Optional:** example pointers / drill links (match IDs, logs) only if they reduce review time.

---

### Section C — Drilldown / Raw Records (Optional)
**Job-to-be-done:** “Show me the underlying records quickly.”  
Not required, for future review
**Required outputs:** <table of events/matches/logs, etc.>  
Include only if it materially reduces debate or back-and-forth.

---

## 8) Diagnostic Card Specification (Reusable Contract)
Each card is a standardized unit of evidence. Define 3–6 cards.
Do not re-define the metric; reference the Signal Design.
Overall Winrate - segmented by ticket ID(first pass)
Overall Role Winrates
Role Winrate(breakdown of above)
Division Winrates


### Diagnostic Card <#> — Overall Winrate by ticket
- **Metric / Signal reference:** Overall winrate- first pass
- **Question it answers:** Which players have higher than average winrates, is it due to games played or other factors?
- **Required segmentation (dimensions):** By ticket, balanced shuffle or player draft
- **Required comparison/baseline:** Expected value for winrates is 50%, with some deviation expected, allowance set at 10%. 
- **Display form:**  Distribution of player winrates
- **Decision states (interpretation rules):** Winrates- High enough for concern? > Games played- Attributed to games played? 
  - **High concern:** Above 60% with more than 30 games
  - **Low Concern:** Above 60% between 10-30 games
  - **Normal:** 40-60% winrates
  - **Inconclusive / insufficient data:** extreme winrates below 10 games
- **Common confounder (1 line):** Caveat- for player draft winrates have higher deviations 
- **Link-out (optional):** <raw examples / records>

### Diagnostic Card <#> — Rank Divison Winrate
- **Metric / Signal reference:** Lobby Division Winrate
- **Question it answers:** What is the player's winrate in different rank divisions? Does this explain their winrates?
- **Required segmentation (dimensions):** Rank Divison(bracket)
- **Required comparison/baseline:** expected 50% with 10% deviations
- **Display form:** Breakdown
- **Decision states (interpretation rules):**
  - **High concern:** Player has winrates consistently above 60% in all rank brackets, notably at brackets higher than their calibrated rank
  - **Low concern:**Player has winrates below 40% consistently at lobbies near their calibrated rank, hinting overcalibrated rank
  - **Normal:** Winrate between 40-60% across brackets, slightly higher at brackets below calibrated rank
  - **Inconclusive / insufficient data:** Winrates with Rank divisions below 10 games automatically excluded
- **Common confounder (1 line):** Players with extreme winrates and high calibrated rank(80) can be investigated seperately
- **Link-out (optional):** <raw examples / records>

### Diagnostic Card <#> — Role winrates
- **Metric / Signal reference:** Role based winrates
- **Question it answers:** Is a player's winrate attributed to a specific role? or is their performance high across roles?
- **Required segmentation (dimensions):** Roles
- **Required comparison/baseline:** Expected value between 40-60% for selected preferred role, lower for off-roles
- **Display form:** Single value, Breakdown-winrate>roles
- **Decision states (interpretation rules):**
  - **High concern:** Overall Winrates above 60% across all roles, 1.6 for combined score
  - **Low concern:** Overall Winrates around 50%, above 1.6 for combined score
  - **Normal:** Winrates around 40-60%, 1.2-1.6 for combined score 
  - **Inconclusive / insufficient data:** Only players with 3 roles played will be considered for combined score 
- **Link-out (optional):** <raw examples / records>
*(Repeat for each card.)*

## 9) Default State (Make It Useful on Open)
Defaults should match the most common operational review session.

- **Default time window:**  1 Year, due to 30 game requirement
- **Default filters:** steam name exists, rank exists 
- **Eligibility gating:** Games played >10 for segmented, 30 for overall 
- **Default sort / ranking:** not applicable to current charts, breakdown possible
- **Default list size:** All players
- **Empty and low-data behavior:**
 low or empty data will result in missing plots, interpreted as not enough games played in a segment for accurate results

---

## 10) Interaction Model (Keep It Simple)
**Primary navigation:** Top to bottom, First pass, select Player(if exists) from filter list for breakdown
**Secondary interactions (optional):**

---

## 11) Data Requirements (Operational Reality)
- **Data sources:** Match data from stratz API>uploaded to database
- **Refresh frequency:** daily
- **Expected latency:** daily
- **Data quality checks (must pass to trust outputs):**
  - <check>
- **Degraded mode:** <what happens if checks fail (banner, disable ranking, etc.)>

## 12) Caveats & Guardrails (Prevent Misinterpretation)
- **Not valid for:**  
  -Not valid for in depth review
  -Player performance review 
- **Best used for:**  
  -Intended usage is as a early warning for potential inaccurate calibration 
  -Spotting outliers that can affect event health
- **Human review required when:**  
  -Outliers spotted within otherwise acceptable ranges, mentioned in role winrate above.
- **Mandatory UI cues:**  
  - Referenced where required- rank rating when rank used  
  - Eligiblity stated- 10 games segmented, 30 games total
  - Baseline consistent across all charts

---

## 13) Build Readiness Gate (Last Stop Before Implementation)
This slice can move into dashboard construction only when:

**Must-have for v1:**
- Sections A and B are fully specified (required outputs + interactions)
- All Diagnostic Cards are specified (states + required dimensions + baseline + insufficient-data behavior)
- Default state is explicit (window, filters, sort, list size)
- Data sources and freshness expectations are defined
- Caveats/guardrails are written and mapped to UI cues

**Nice-to-have (v2):**
- <1–5 bullets>

**Dependencies / instrumentation gaps:**
- <missing fields, backfills, logging needs>

**Open questions (max 5):**
- <threshold/baseline unknowns, missing dimension, unresolved definition>
