“North Star” plus guardrails

Many successful product orgs use a North Star Metric (single metric capturing user value) plus guardrail/counter metrics to prevent “winning” in a way that causes harm. 
Amplitude
+1

For a gaming social club, a plausible shape is:

North Star: “Active members getting value weekly” (you define “value” as: attended an event, joined voice, played inhouse, etc.)

Guardrails: toxicity incidents, mod actions, churn, “new member drop-off,” event no-show rate

North Star Metric, for PwR:
- Number of members spending more than 2 hours in voice, every week.
